#__Text Booker__

##Project Description
The purpose of Text Booker is to allow students at colleges and universities to connect and sell their textbooks without a middle-man, so that they, the students, have the ability to mutually determine the price with the convenience of a timely sale.

_Note: No money transactions are made through this app, rather it acts as a digital and costless middle-man._

##Motivations
As poor college students, we really don't care for the high prices of books and the long shipping times associated with buying used books online. So, we tried to find a college specific solution.
